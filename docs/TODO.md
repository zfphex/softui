- [ ] Layout slices and mutable slices...
- [ ] Better widgets, lists, button
- [ ] Styling, rounded borders, em sizing.
- [ ] Lines widget with line wrapping (how to handle clicking different lines???)
- [ ] Frame-rate limiter
- [ ] The custom primative functions do not allow for any arguments such as radius on area, so it's not very useful.
- [ ] Rewrite almost every single instance of Rect with UnitRect, the current layout system does not allow for relative units.
- [ ] Style and click propigation is awful...
- [ ] Primative currently has no lifetime since static mut does not support it. Image/Svg should probably use RefCell or something.
